## Covid-19 statement
NZNOG has been running for many years and is highly regarded for both its content and the community aspect of the conference. The conference has been delayed from January until May. We may still need to cancel the May conference if conditions do now allow the conference to take place.

Please note, that even with the protection of vaccines that our vaccine mandate gives, that Covid spread may happen at the conference.
