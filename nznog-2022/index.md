**Covid-19 statement**
NZNOG has been running for many years and is highly regarded for both its content and the community aspect of the conference. Due to this, if the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic does not allow our standard, expected conference in January 2022, the NZNOG Trustees will postpone or cancel the conference. We have secured backup dates in May 2022, however, if this is still impacted by COVID-19 we will need to cancel for 2022.
