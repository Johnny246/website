## APNIC SDN Workshop
**Dates: Monday 28 Jan to Wednesday 30 Jan**

### Synopsis

The emergence of SDN (Software Defined Network) has had a disruptive influence on the world of data networking, leading to a fundamental re-think of how networks are designed. This technical workshop will provide an in-depth understanding of the key technological elements of SDN via a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises.

### Target audience

Technical staff currently operating an IP and/or MPLS network who are interested in understanding the impact of SDN with a view of implementing elements of SDN in the near future.

### Prerequisites

It is assumed that participants will have intermediate-level knowledge of IP routing, routing protocols, management protocols, MPLS protocols, and traffic-engineering.

Please see the following URL for more details - <https://training.apnic.net/courses/wsdn01-SDN>

**Important :** Please note this is a 5 day workshop condensed in to 3 days. It is likely the workshop will conclude at approximately the BGP content in the course. See above link for more details.

## TICSA Workshop for Network Operators
**Date: Wednesday 30 January**

A practical workshop for **registered Network Operators only**.

**Chatham House Rules will apply** - <https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule>

**9.30am start time**

This workshop will include a live demonstration of the [OpenLI](https://openli.nz/) platform developed and funded by our industry to meet our Lawful Intercept needs.

Hosted by NZ Police, NCSC, and WAND.

**Agenda for the day:**
- **Introduction - Dave Mill**
- **Security - Part 3 of the TICSA**
    - Introduction by the NCSC
    - Example proposal - Dave Mill
    - Assessing a proposal - NCSC
    - Example standard build
- **Lawful Intercept - Part 2 of the TICSA**
    - Practical information on what the NZ Police require when doing a lawful intercept - Neil Tapp, NZ Police
    - Introduction to the OpenLI project - Richard Nelson, WAND
    - Workshop on using OpenLI to perform a lawful intercept - Shane Alcock, WAND; Neil Tapp, NZ Police

* **General discussions, wrap-up**

**It is expected that after attending the workshop participants will know:**
* How to submit a proposal to the NCSC under Part 3 of the TICSA
* What the NCSC look at when assessing a proposal under Part 3 of the TICSA
* What the NZ Police require when an operator is required to perform a lawful intercept in NZ
* What OpenLI is and how it came about
* How to set-up and use OpenLI to perform a lawful intercept

Note: Attendees who wish to attempt an OpenLI install themselves as part of the workshop are encouraged to bring a laptop to the workshop. We will have both VM images and Docker files available that can be used to create a sandbox environment for experimenting with OpenLI. If you're planning on using Docker, your host OS will need to be Linux. The VMs should work on Windows and MacOS as well as Linux, but you'll want at least 8GB of RAM.

## Network Automation Workshop - Egor Krivosheev
**Date: Wednesday 30 January**

The Network Automation Workshop will cover different topics including:* Configuration management
* Telemetry
* Programmatic interfaces
* Maintaining configuration consistency
* Service provisioning

You will get experience with tools like Ansible and Docker. We will cover common approaches and reference architectures so you can obtain knowledge and build the automation framework that fits your needs.

It is expected that you are familiar with a flavour of Linux and the basic concepts of Go or Python programing language.

Streaming telemetry is becoming a large part of networking today so will look into how we can collect, store and analyse high-frequency data with tools like Grafana, Elasticsearch and InfluxDB.
