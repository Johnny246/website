NZNOG is trialling the use of Slack for real-time discussion between NZ Network Operators.

This is not intended in anyway to replace the public mailing list; only to foster real-time discussions, be they in the open channels, or private messages directly between individuals.

Additionally, we expect that there will be discussion during the conference in conference-specific channels.

This Slack is invite only. Invites must be nominated through the Slack itself, and approved by admins. Existing members can nominate new members, please see the Code of Conduct for information.

Members should use their real names, or names by which your colleagues know you. Yes this is problematic in some circles, however, this Slack requires trust between networks in NZ, and as such anonymity is not a virtue in this case.

Don't post secret stuff, passwords, etc.

Please read ourÂ [Code of Conduct](slack/slack-code-of-conduct.html).
