We do have arrangements in place to allow postponement of the conference if the pandemic resurges but at this stage we do not anticipate that it will be necessary.

We are seeking sponsors and will have a sponsorship document available. For details contact [sponsorship@nznog.org](mailto:sponsorship@nznog.org).
