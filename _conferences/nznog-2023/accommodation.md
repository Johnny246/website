## Conference Venue - Rydges Hotel

We have secured a delegate rate for the conference attendees.

Special NZNOG room rates have a block reserved, however this will be released on a monthly basis prior to the conference. We suggest booking early if you want to stay at the conference venue itself, as this hotel can be busy in March.

* A contact number/email and credit card must be provided.
* Guests are responsible for payment of the room direct to the hotel.
* If cancellation/postponement is required due to Covid-19 lockdowns or restrictions, no penalty will be charged
