## Conference objective
The NZNOG conference, workshops and tutorials are a once-a-year opportunity for individuals and organisations involved in Internet operations to meet and share the latest in Internet operations, technologies, practices, and receive high quality training.

The event is unique in New Zealand and attracts technical, skilled individuals with a genuine interest in Internet operations and Internetworking technologies.

Submissions on any aspect of networking are welcome however we are particularly interested in talks that involve real world deployment experience, particularly in New Zealand.
